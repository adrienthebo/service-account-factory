- Move the terraform-provider-gsuite to the right location

## Development
### Requirements
- [bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) 0.4.0
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) 1.5
- [terraform-docs](https://github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs/releases) 0.3.0

### Integration testing
The integration tests for this module are built with bats, basically the test checks the following:
- Perform `terraform init` command
- Perform `terraform get` command
- Perform `terraform plan` command and check that it'll create *n* resources, modify 0 resources and delete 0 resources
- Perform `terraform apply -auto-approve` command and check that it has created the *n* resources, modified 0 resources and deleted 0 resources
- Perform several `gcloud` commands and check the infrastructure is in the desired state
- Perform `terraform destroy -force` command and check that it has destroyed the *n* resources

You can use the following command to run the integration test in the folder */test/integration/gcloud-test*

  `. launch.sh`

### Autogeneration of documentation from .tf files
Run
```
make generate_docs
```

### Linting
The makefile in this project will lint or sometimes just format any shell,
Python, golang, Terraform, or Dockerfiles. The linters will only be run if
the makefile finds files with the appropriate file extension.

All of the linter checks are in the default make target, so you just have to
run

```
make -s
```

The -s is for 'silent'. Successful output looks like this

```
Running shellcheck
Running flake8
Running gofmt
Running terraform validate
Running hadolint on Dockerfiles
Test passed - Verified all file Apache 2 headers
```

The linters
are as follows:
* Shell - shellcheck. Can be found in homebrew
* Python - flake8. Can be installed with 'pip install flake8'
* Golang - gofmt. gofmt comes with the standard golang installation. golang
is a compiled language so there is no standard linter.
* Terraform - terraform has a built-in linter in the 'terraform validate'
command.
* Dockerfiles - hadolint. Can be found in homebrew
